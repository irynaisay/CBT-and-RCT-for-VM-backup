# CBT and RCT for VM backup
## PROs and CONs

Backups is one of the many pain points for system administrators and consequently for their companies. Companies develop and approve retention policies determining backup requirements, procedures, and options, which may vary depending on the needs faced and resources available. Backups of virtual machines expose even higher risks.

As [technopedia determines](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4805/virtual-machine-vm), a virtual machine (VM) is a software or an operating system that runs applications and programs as well as performs multiple tasks just as a real computer.

Backups for VMs do not differ from traditional backups. 

Changed Block Tracking (CBT) provides for incremental backups.
